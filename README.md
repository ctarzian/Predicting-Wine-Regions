# Predicting-Wine-Regions

Analzyed a comprehensive dataset of wine reviews from around the world (https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).

Utilized both regression and classification machine learning techniques to predict wine points (ratings) and wine regions respecitively.

Work is spread out across three different jupyter notebooks. 
  1. Topic Modeling for Top Wine Regions
  2. Predicting (Classifying) Wine Regions
  3. Predicting Wine Points (Rating)

The Multilayer Perceptron was our best performing model both for the regression and classification models. For the regression, it outperformed the Random Forest Model and had a RMSE of 0.0777 and an R2 Score (coefficient of determination) of 0.7563. In terms of predicitn regions, it outperformed both the Logisitic Regression and the Random Forest Model which was indicative of its strong precision, recall and f1 scores. All metrics averaged 88% which is noticeably strong for a multi-classification model.
